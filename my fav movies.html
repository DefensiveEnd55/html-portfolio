<h1> Ivan's fav movies as the first of their kind.</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Superman circa 1978</h2><p>
The First Major Superhero Movie
As a blockbuster, it was building on the success of <br>films like Star Wars, Jaws, 
and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. 
However, it was<br> the first foray into the world of comic-book superheroes on the 
big screen that had some real<br>weight behind it.
Scored by John Williams and nominated for multiple Academy Awards,<br>the film also 
starred A-listers like Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman.</p>

<h2>Blade Runner circa 1982</h2>
<p>
Blade Runner, great noir sci-fi, great mood and setting. The android characters 
(especially Rutger Hauer)<br>give off an aura of aliveness, which fits the story very well. 
The cinematography and sets are excellent<br>(as with other Ridley Scott films). 
All-in-all Blade Runner lives up to its reputation as a sci-fi classic.<br>
Awards and nominations
Blade Runner has both won, and been nominated for, many awards<br>too numerous to mention here.

<h2>Ong Bak 1 circa 2003</h2>
Ong Bak is one of the most iconic martial arts movies of all time. Countless 
Muay Thai practitioners<br>were inspired by this film, and it gave Muay Thai an 
international stage in ways no athlete ever could.<br> Tony Jaa is a legend for 
what he contributed to muay thai, and make no mistake, he is highly<br> skilled 
in performing muay thai moves and very athletic. It makes sense that he<br> was 
trained by Yodtong Senanan, the greatest Muay Thai trainer of all time.
